            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Alejandro Lopez. I'm an aspiring Web Developer and wanted to show off my work. Depending on when you're reading this, this porfolio maybe either humble and 
                a small start, or the impressive library. My technical background is front-end work building and maintaining websites on WordPress using the Divi theme. I'm hoping to branch
                into full-stack work programming and letting my creativity flow.
            </p>
            <p>I'm the second of four boys so I'm no stranger to being competitive. I'm also into nerdier things like Warhammer 40k and Magic the Gathering. While I wouldn't say I'm an expert
                in either, I love learning about them and am always down to play a game. I like to paint my 40k miniatures which means I have an eye for detail. Believe you me, you start to 
                notice smaller details when you're trying to paint a figure the size of your thumb. Besides that, I'm a huge fan of rock climbing. I used to be pretty good a few years ago,
                dishing out finger pull-ups like they were nothing, but responsibility started calling and I was forced to answer. I am however, confident that I can still do at least 5 finger
                pull-ups and would bet a job that I can do it. 
            </p>
            <p>Hopefully you see something in this portfolio that you like. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. If you have a job offer, <strong>definitely</strong>
            contact me and I'd love to chat. Keep it sleezy people</p>
