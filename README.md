# lopez-portfolio

THe Challenge for this week was to build a portfolio from scratch to demonstrate the projects I've done and will do for the rest of this bootcamp. It needed to follow the following parameters:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

While I'm proud to say I got it mostly completed how I liked it, making it responsive gave me problems so their may still be issues.
